governors island, drone journalism

In May 2014, a new 30-acre park will open in New York on Governors Island. For over 200 years, Governors Island had been a military installation, first used by the Army, and in 1966 transferred to the Coast Guard. In the mid 2000s, Governors Island opened to the public as a space for a variety of purposes: arts installations, concerts, food fairs, car shows, and more. 

For the past several years, however, a completely new park on the island has been designed with public input as to how they would want to see a 21st century park in NYC. Though closed to the public until Memorial Day, this phase of the park is largely completed, empty on weekends, and visually appealing.

A drone journalism project about the new park on Governors Island would be the ideal story for our class to tell. It’s relevant to New Yorkers and timed well with when our project would finish, we have an excellent chance of getting the cooperation of park officials who could work with us to give us access to park designers and other informational sources, there would be little to no safety or privacy concerns, and, most importantly, using a drone would allow us to visually tell a story that couldn’t be told any other way.
